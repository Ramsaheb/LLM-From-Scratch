📓 Project Notebook
📖 Overview
This repository currently contains one main Jupyter Notebook with the complete source code.
I’ve completed 21 out of 43 tutorial videos so far, and I’ll continue updating this as I progress.

📚 Source Code
The notebook includes source code adapted from the professor’s original materials.
I’ve chosen this approach because:

It’s clear and easy to understand

It’s well-organized for learning

It’s great for anyone following along with the course

🚀 Progress
✅ Videos completed: 21 / 43

⏳ Ongoing updates as new videos are covered

📝 Notes
The code will be updated in this same notebook, so you’ll always find the latest version here.

If you’re following the course, this should be an easy reference.
